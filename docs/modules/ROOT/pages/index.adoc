# United States Army Cyber School Contribution Guidelines

This site is designed to outline the processes by which members of the Army component of the Cyber Mission Force may
(at the individual level)
open issues against,
suggest changes to (via the https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[github flow]),
and otherwise contribute to the unclassified and public official courseware and environment templates of the United States Army Cyber School.

*Please note that all content contained on the public version control system at https://git.cybbh.space is unclassified with no handling caveats.
Suggestions about changes to courses that contain classified materials or unclassified materials with handling caveats should be handled on the appropriate network.*

As a general rule, if you are looking to implement a change or suggestion that a reasonable person would consider to be 'military specific' and generally would not be applicable to the private sector,
it probably does not belong on this forum.  Consult your SSO/S2 as appropriate if you are unsure.

This information system is accredited to handle information that is considered 'for public release'.
All projects are licensed with the Apache 2.0 license where possible and derivative works respect the upstream license requirements where necessary.

While we can only accept input from members of the CMF,
any person or organization is free to use any/all publicly available materials on this documentation site and on the version control system in accordance with the provided license(s).

## Guide Overview

After reading this documentation,
you will be able to:

* [x] Understand how United States Army Cyber School (USACYS) courses are structured,
and why
* [x] Learn how to suggest a new feature or bugfix in a course
* [x] Learn how to fork official courseware and build your own courses to address gaps identified in your organizations,
and then share them with the rest of the community
* [x] Learn how to read and write heat templates and murano packages for use on the VTA
* [x] Find other novel ways to apply modern software development practices and toolchains to traditionally low-tech problems

## How to use this guide

This documentation site was built with https://antora.org/[antora] and takes a modular,
decentralized approach to documentation creation and maintenance.

The repository that holds the general contribution guidelines (what you are reading right now) are maintain in a namespace that is separate from the actual courses and only contains general guidance that will apply to any contributions that you wish to make to the Cyber School.
On the bottom left of this page,
you will notice a navigation drawer that has several different course-specific guides listed.
Those are maintained by the actual instructors,
content developers,
and course managers for a given course.

Be sure to read the course-specific guidelines in addition to the general guidelines before attempting to make a contribution.
This will ensure that your request/changeset is reviewd and acted on as quickly as possible.

## Where to start

If this is your first time using a version control system (for anything, not just courseware), you should probably start with xref:courseware-as-code.adoc[Courseware as Code].

If this isn't your first rodeo, you can go ahead and skip to the xref:general-guidelines.adoc[general guidelines] themselves.
If you need an account (or had one previously but forgot the password),
head over to xref:getting-started.adoc[getting started].
