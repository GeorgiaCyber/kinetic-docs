# What is Courseware as Code?

Courseware as code is a method of maintaining educational materials using the same techniques and tools that developers do when writing software,
specifically when using the https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/[agile] development strategy.
In short,
its an attempt to fundamentally change the way that educational materials are developed,
maintained,
and shared with the designated recipients.

We recently wrote and presented a WIP that was accepted at the 2018 Frontiers in Education conference.
You can read the final version of the paper link:{attachmentsdir}/coursewareascode.pdf[here].

## Why it matters

You're probably familiar with the traditional way that courses are taught,
at least in the armed forces.
There are powerpoint slides,
PDF handouts,
videos,
ebooks,
word documents,
blackboard projects,
etc.
All of these items are considered https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-little-diddy-about-binary-file-formats/[binary file formats],
which essentially mean that they are very difficult for humans to read and edit without specialized software (Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, etc.).

There is certainly a place for these kinds of files;
they are best suited for materials that don't change very often and where ease of distribution trumps flexibility.
Cyberspace Operations and most other high-tech fields change *constantly*.
Maintaining a fleet of individualized word documents,
powerpoint slides,
student handouts,
and more across multiple schedules,
physical locations,
courses,
and instructors,
quickly becomes untenable.

We experimented with things like Google Docs and collaborative editing,
but found them to be lacking for one reason or another,
usually due to difficulties when attempting templatization or re-using assets where applicable.
This kind of collaborative editing software just wasn't flexibile enough for our use case.

## Plain text is best

The other type of format is called a plain text file.
It is exactly what it sounds like - plain characters stored in an encoded (e.g. UTF-8) text file that is completely devoid of content that can't be represented by the chosen encoding.
They can be read an edited by humans using any available text editor and almost all shells on modern operating systems without the assistance of special software.

By treating all of our content as plain text,
we can leverage the modern developer toolchain to create and maintain all of our courseware in the rapid and distributed manner that this field demands.

## How we do it

While the simplicity and elegance of having everything stored as text is evident,
there are situations where some kind of markup is required.
Drawing attention to a key point in a handout,
providing some kind of syntax highlighting for any source code,
embedding images,
and other similar actions are desirable in the classroom in many cases.

If everything is stored as plain text,
how do you represent these various necessities?

## Asciidoc

A markup language is a way of representing non-text objects with text.
We sort of do this naturally already in our daily lives.
If you were writing a text message and wanted to emphasize a word or phrase,
you might surround it with '*',
or use an exclamation point,
or any other number of methods in an attempt to convey meaning beyond what the text explicitly states.

A markup language takes this concept and applies it as widely as possible.
Here is an example:

[source, asciidoc]
----
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, *consectetur adipiscing elit*, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

* Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
* Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

WARNING: Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
----

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, *consectetur adipiscing elit*, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

* Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
* Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

WARNING: Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

What you see above is the same exact plain text,
but represented in two different ways.

The first example is contained within source code blocks,
which means that it is to be interpreted literally and printed to the screen exactly as written without any processing.
You can see the various '*' characters and WARNING admonition present,
but unrendered

The second example is the same exact text without being bounded by the source code blocks.
Instead of writing literal '\*' characters and 'WARNING:',
the system has rendered them in human-consumable format,
namely by bolding text that is bounded by '*',
creating a bulleted list when lines are prefixed by '*',
and creating a warning callout when a line is preceeded by 'WARNING:'

By allowing computers to interpret our markup language and automatically turn it into something visually pleasing on our behalf,
we can focus on writing the content itself using a version control system.

USACYS has chosen the gitlab implementation of the git protocol as our version control system along with the asciidoc markup language.
Other common choices in these categories could have included github,
markdown,
svn,
RST,
and others.
