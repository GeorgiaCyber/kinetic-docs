= Georgia Cyber Range User Guide

This page will ensure that you make the most out of your Georgia Cyber Range account.

[#you-should-know]
== Things You Should Know

There are a few things you should know...

. Your Georgia Cyber Range project has the ability to directly connect any/all of your instances to the internet.
. You are responsible for everything that happens inside of your Georgia Cyber Range project.
. You must abide by the https://fixmeandmakemearealurl[Terms of Service] that you signed when your account was issued.

Violating this agreement will result in immediate termination of services and no refund will be issued.

[#dashboard-cli-api]
== The Dashboard, the CLI, and the API

There are three different ways to use the Georgia Cyber Range:

. https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/user/index.html[The OpenStack Dashboard]
. https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/[The OpenStack CLI]
. https://docs.openstack.org/api-quick-start/[The OpenStack API]

You should use the Dashboard if:

* You have never used a Cyber Range or a Cloud Service before
* You want to manually create resources
* You prefer a web interface to a command line client

The dashboard exposes the smallest amount of available functionality,
but is the easiest to use.

You should use the CLI if:

* You have experience with using cloud services
* You want to automate your use of the Georgia Cyber Range as much as possible

The CLI provides a good mix of available functionality and ease of use.

You should use the API if:

* You are a programmer
* You wish to incorporate your GCR resources into a larger effort/project

The API exposes all functionality but can be challenging for new users.

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume that you will use the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon).

[#the-dashboard]
== The OpenStack Dashboard

The OpenStack Dashboard provides a simple interface to the most common functions of the Georgia Cyber Range.
This section will touch on basic utilization of the most common features and provide links to more extensive upstream user documentation.

[#compute-overview]
=== Compute Overview

When you first log in to the GCR, you will be presented with the Compute Overview Screen:

This screen will summarize your current GCR resource utilization when compared against what you have reserved in your account.
This screen will be empty when you log in for the first time,
but will populate as you create various resources.

[#apis]
=== API Access

The API Access tab provides the current list of API endpoints for use.

image::api-access.png[API Access]

It also provides RC files that allow you to use the OpenStack CLI easily.

[#instances]
=== Instances

The instances tab allows you to view all of your currently deployed instances (virtual machines).

image::instances.png[Instances View]

It also lets you perform common functions such as start, stop, reboot, and destroy,
as well as gather useful information about your instances such as assigned IP address and power state.

[#images]
=== Images

The images tab allows you to view all of the publicly available images in the GCR as well as any private images you have uploaded specifically to your project.

You may also edit the metadata and properties of images that you own,
and share images with other projects.

You can also assign various properties to your volumes and configure them to be either read-only or read-write from here.

[#network-topology]
=== Network Topology

The network topology tab will give you a visual representation of all of your currently configured instances,
networks,
and routers.

You also have direct access to the consoles of all of your instances from this page.

[#networks]
=== Networks

The networks tab displays all of the networks that you have access too,
both those you have created and those that have been shared with you (such as public).

image::networks.png[Networks Tab]

From this page,
