= Georgia Cyber Range User Guide

This page will ensure that you make the most out of your Georgia Cyber Range account.

[#you-should-know]
== Things You Should Know

There are a few things you should know...

. Your Georgia Cyber Range project has the ability to directly connect any/all of your instances to the internet.
. You are responsible for everything that happens inside of your Georgia Cyber Range project.
. You must abide by the https://fixmeandmakemearealurl[Terms of Service] that you signed when your account was issued.

Violating this agreement will result in immediate termination of services and no refund will be issued.

[#dashboard-cli-api]
== The Dashboard, the CLI, and the API

There are three different ways to use the Georgia Cyber Range:

. https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/user/index.html[The OpenStack Dashboard]
. https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/[The OpenStack CLI]
. https://docs.openstack.org/api-quick-start/[The OpenStack API]

You should use the Dashboard if:

* You have never used a Cyber Range or a Cloud Service before
* You want to manually create resources
* You prefer a web interface to a command line client

The dashboard exposes the smallest amount of available functionality,
but is the easiest to use.

You should use the CLI if:

* You have experience with using cloud services
* You want to automate your use of the Georgia Cyber Range as much as possible

The CLI provides a good mix of available functionality and ease of use.

You should use the API if:

* You are a programmer
* You wish to incorporate your GCR resources into a larger effort/project

The API exposes all functionality but can be challenging for new users.

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume that you will use the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon).

[#the-dashboard]

This screen will be empty when you log in for the first time,
but will populate as you create various resources.
